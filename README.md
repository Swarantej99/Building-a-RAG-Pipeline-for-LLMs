# Building-a-RAG-Pipeline-for-LLMs

A production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that combines vector-based document retrieval and large language model (LLM) generation for accurate, contextual responses using your own knowledge base.

## 📌 Overview

This project enhances LLM performance by feeding it with relevant external documents. It retrieves semantically similar document chunks using vector search (FAISS) and passes them into a generative model (e.g., GPT) for grounded, domain-specific answers.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧠 Embedding-based document indexing using `SentenceTransformers`
- 🔍 Semantic search using `FAISS` for low-latency retrieval
- 🤖 Contextual generation using Hugging Face `transformers` (GPT, etc.)
- 📄 Support for custom `.txt` and `.pdf` document ingestion
- 💬 Fully customizable for any domain (e.g., legal, healthcare, education)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- `Python`, `PyTorch`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `transformers` (Hugging Face)
- `FAISS`
- Optional: `Streamlit` for UI
